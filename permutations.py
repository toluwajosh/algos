"""
Output all the permutations and compute the code time complexity if your code is good enough,
the time complexity should be n!
but when i was interviewing with the two interviewers, i wrote a n^n solution.
Actually, there are recursive and iterative solutions in n! time complexity.
The best solution should call next permutation function n! times.

Hint:
Permutations, nPr = n!/(n-r)!
